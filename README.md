# Poula Farid — Fresh Graduate Software Engineer

I design and implement reliable software systems with measurable product impact. I deliver end-to-end solutions: specification, implementation, testing, and deployment. Below is a concise selection of public projects that demonstrate practical experience in machine learning, data engineering, and full‑stack application development.
